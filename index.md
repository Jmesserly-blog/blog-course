### Not generative, but worth a look
                                                                                                         
Stability AI has made generative AI less tedious to work with through the use of Variational Autoencoders. The compression algorithms map
                                                                                                         
                                                                                                         
                                                                                                         
### This project assumes that...

*   You have a strong understanding of basic color theory, including HSV coordinates, as well as basic white balance concepts (the gray world algorithm)
*   You're comfortable with pytorch and fully convolutional neural networks, and you've at least heard of GANs 
*   You're familiar with variational autoencoders, the latent space, and programming with the HuggingFace diffusers library. If not, then you've heard of them, and you'd like to learn more

Although it does not assume you know GIMP, I suggest you download it (for free) and try it out! It will get you through most of your image data needs when you don't feel like writing an entire python script to do something.
